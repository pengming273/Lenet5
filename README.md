Pengfei's experiments based on Lenet5

This is my first experiment on Github. In this experiment I use the codes of deeplearning.net to train convolutional neural networks. And based on the codes I have added some convolutional layers and hidden layers to classify the MNIST. Also, I have generated some new examples such as triangles, circles and rectangles for the CNNs to classify. Reza and I are now discussing how the parameters of networks will influence the results.
